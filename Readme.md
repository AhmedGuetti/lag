# Lag Library
A general library in Cpp that hole as much onne header libraries as possible
## List of Library
- gmatrix
    - Library that hole a matrix data structure and some linear algebra function 
    - Could be helpful for 2D/3D work or for simple AI 
- gcomplex
    - Library that hold a data structure for Complex number and the arithmetique under the hode
    - am not sure if there is a use for it but it's here if you need it to model something

# TO DO
- [] Document the code of Complex number, each method seperatly  
- [] Add a md file to explain the Complex number calculation
- [] Finish the complex arithmetic function
- [] Finish the gmatrix functionality
- [] Search for the next header file
